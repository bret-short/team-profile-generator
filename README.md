Team Profile Generator

Is a profile generator that is generated from the command line with the command node index.js. 

Anyone can use this simple team profile generator even with no technical experience. 

When the user executes the command they are presented with questions about each individual team member including their name, role, email address, phone number, school or github username. 

Upon completion of the questions an easy to read HTML file is generated with all of the input information easy to read and keep track of.
